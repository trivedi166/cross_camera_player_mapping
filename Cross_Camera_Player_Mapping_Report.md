# ðŸ“„ Cross-Camera Player Mapping â€“ Project Report

## 1. Objective

The aim of this project is to detect and match soccer players across two different camera perspectives â€” `broadcast` and `tacticam` â€” using a YOLOv8 object detector and ResNet-based appearance embeddings.

---

## 2. Dataset

- **Videos Used:**
  - `broadcast.mp4`
  - `tacticam.mp4`

These videos were provided as part of the challenge and are used to extract frames and detect players and the ball.

---

## 3. Model

- **Object Detector:** YOLOv8  
  A fine-tuned YOLOv8 model (`best.pt`) was provided for detecting `player`, `ball`, `goalkeeper`, and `referee`.

- **Embedding Model:** ResNet-18  
  Pretrained on ImageNet and used to extract 512-dimensional feature vectors for each detected player.

---

## 4. Pipeline

### Step 1: Frame Extraction
- Extract frames from both videos using OpenCV.
- Save them under:
  - `outputs/broadcast_frames/`
  - `outputs/tacticam_frames/`

### Step 2: Player & Ball Detection
- Run the YOLOv8 model on each frame.
- Only bounding boxes for class `"player"` are considered for matching.

### Step 3: Embedding Extraction
- Each detected player is cropped.
- Embeddings are extracted using ResNet-18 and saved as `.npy` files.

### Step 4: Player Matching
- Cosine similarity is computed between player embeddings from broadcast and tacticam frames.
- Hungarian algorithm is used to optimally match players.

### Step 5: Visualization
- Matched bounding boxes are drawn across both camera views.
